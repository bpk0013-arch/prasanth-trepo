🚀 **Introducing Prasanth TRepo - Your Go-To JMeter Report Generator!**

I'm excited to share my latest open-source project that solves a problem every performance engineer faces: turning raw JMeter results into professional reports.

**The Problem:**
Spending 2-3 hours manually creating reports from JMeter CSV files. Stakeholders struggle to understand milliseconds. No company branding. Tedious Excel formatting.

**The Solution: Prasanth TRepo**
A free, standalone tool that generates beautiful PDF and Excel reports in 3 minutes!

**✨ Key Features:**

📊 **Professional Reports**
• Company logo integration
• Sky blue professional theme
• PDF + Excel output simultaneously
• Error highlighting (red cells = instant attention)

⏱️ **Readable Metrics**
• Response times in SECONDS (1.234s vs 1234ms)
• Min, Max, Average, 90th percentile
• Much clearer for stakeholders!

📈 **Visual Analysis**
• Response Time charts
• Transactions Per Second (TPS) charts
• Active Threads Over Time charts
• Error analysis with HTTP codes (500, 404, etc.)

🎯 **Zero Setup**
• Standalone Windows executable
• No Python installation needed
• No dependencies required
• Just download and run!

**Real Impact:**
⏱️ Saves 2-3 hours per report (95% time reduction)
💼 Professional branding for client deliverables
📊 Better insights with visual charts
🎯 Faster decision-making with clear metrics

**Perfect For:**
• Performance Engineers
• QA Teams
• Testing Consultants
• DevOps Teams
• Anyone using JMeter

**Why I Built This:**
I was tired of wasting hours on manual reporting. I wanted to focus on actual testing and analysis, not formatting. So I built a tool that does it all automatically.

**It's Completely FREE and Open Source!** 🎉
